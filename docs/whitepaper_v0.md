# SentinelZero — Whitepaper v0

## 1. Executive Summary
SentinelZero is a post-audit risk monitoring framework designed to reduce the exposure of DeFi protocols on BNB Chain (and beyond) to exploits and attacks.  
It leverages historical attack data, automated risk scoring, and a continuous learning approach to provide actionable insights for developers, investors, and ecosystem participants.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
- Audits are point-in-time; they cannot prevent post-deployment exploits.  
- Exploit patterns are often repeated across protocols.  
- Small and mid-tier projects lack resources to implement continuous monitoring.  
- Current ecosystem tooling is either too slow, expensive, or inaccessible.

---

## 3. SentinelZero Solution
- Historical exploit database  
- Exploit taxonomy & risk scoring  
- Automated risk calculator prototype  
- Dashboard for developers and investors (future)  
- Continuous learning from new exploits

---

## 4. Methodology
1. Collect historical exploits (public reports, blogs, datasets)  
2. Individual hack analysis (template-based)  
3. Risk scoring framework applied to each protocol  
4. Cross-case correlation & pattern identification  
5. Continuous update to scoring model

---

## 5. Roadmap (6 Months)
| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | 6–8 weeks | Historical exploit database |
| Phase 2 | 8–12 weeks | Taxonomy & initial scoring |
| Phase 3 | 12–16 weeks | MVP dashboard |
| Phase 4 | 4–6 weeks | Whitepaper & open-source documentation |

---

## 6. Expected Impact
- Improved visibility of smart contract risks  
- Reduced likelihood of post-audit exploits  
- Actionable insights for developers and investors  
- Encourages best practices across the BNB Chain ecosystem

---

## 7. Budget Estimate (USD)
| Phase | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Phase 1 | $15,000 |
| Phase 2 | $30,000 |
| Phase 3 | $45,000 |
| Phase 4 | $20,000 |
| **Total** | $110,000 |
