# SentinelZero — Vision Document

## 1. Core Problem
Despite audits, DeFi protocols continue to suffer post-audit exploits.
Security today is reactive, fragmented, and static.

## 2. Fundamental Hypothesis
Most exploits are not novel.
They follow recurring patterns that can be:
- categorized
- scored
- monitored
- predicted probabilistically

## 3. SentinelZero Thesis
SentinelZero is a post-audit risk monitoring and intelligence framework
that learns from historical exploits to reduce future attack surface.

## 4. What SentinelZero Is NOT
- Not a real-time chain halting system
- Not a validator-level enforcement tool
- Not a replacement for audits

## 5. What SentinelZero IS
- A risk observability layer
- A historical exploit intelligence engine
- A decision-support system for protocols, auditors, and funds

## 6. Long-Term Vision
A neutral security intelligence layer
used across multiple chains and ecosystems.
