# Exploit Taxonomy

## Objective
This taxonomy classifies exploit types based on root causes, observable signals,
and systemic risk amplification factors.

It enables structured risk detection beyond static code audits.

---

## Core Exploit Classes

### 1. Contract Logic Exploits
**Description:**  
Flaws in state handling, execution order, or permission logic.

**Examples:**  
- Reentrancy (The DAO)
- Incorrect access controls
- Integer manipulation

**Observable Signals:**
- External calls before state updates
- Recursive execution depth anomalies
- Repeated state mutations in single transactions

**SentinelZero Flag:**  
`LOGIC_ORDER_RISK`

---

### 2. Oracle & Economic Exploits
**Description:**  
Manipulation of external or on-chain price feeds to exploit protocol assumptions.

**Examples:**  
- Flash loan price manipulation (bZx)
- Single-source oracle dependency

**Observable Signals:**
- Price divergence across markets
- Flash loan usage preceding protocol actions
- High-slippage transactions

**SentinelZero Flag:**  
`ORACLE_DEPENDENCY_RISK`

---

### 3. Governance & Permission Exploits
**Description:**  
Abuse of centralized control or delayed governance mechanisms.

**Examples:**  
- Malicious governance proposals
- Admin key compromise

**Observable Signals:**
- High concentration of admin privileges
- Long execution delays
- Emergency pause absence

**SentinelZero Flag:**  
`GOVERNANCE_CENTRALIZATION_RISK`

---

### 4. Infrastructure & Bridge Exploits
**Description:**  
Failures in cross-chain or off-chain components.

**Examples:**  
- Ronin Bridge validator compromise
- Wormhole signature forgery

**Observable Signals:**
- Low validator threshold
- Unusual bridge transfer sizes
- Signature pattern anomalies

**SentinelZero Flag:**  
`INFRASTRUCTURE_TRUST_RISK`

---

### 5. Monitoring & Response Failures
**Description:**  
Lack of detection or delayed reaction magnifying exploit impact.

**Examples:**  
- Multi-day exploit discovery delays
- Absence of alerts for large transfers

**Observable Signals:**
- Large value movements without alerts
- Long periods of monitoring inactivity

**SentinelZero Flag:**  
`OBSERVABILITY_GAP_RISK`

---

## Risk Amplification Factors

| Factor | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Centralization | Increases blast radius |
| Liquidity Thinness | Easier price manipulation |
| Governance Latency | Slower incident response |
| Monitoring Absence | Exploits persist longer |

---

## Taxonomy Application
Each protocol can be scored across:
- Presence of exploit classes
- Severity of observable signals
- Historical pattern similarity

This enables continuous, post-audit risk assessment.

---

## SentinelZero Differentiation
Traditional audits answer:
"Is the code correct?"

SentinelZero answers:
"What is most likely to break next?"
