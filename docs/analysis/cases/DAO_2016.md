# The DAO Hack (2016)

## 1. Incident Overview
- Protocol Name: The DAO
- Date: June 17, 2016
- Chain: Ethereum
- Category: Governance / Smart Contract Logic

## 2. Financial Impact
- Funds lost: ~3.6 million ETH (~USD 60M at the time)
- Assets involved: ETH
- Recovery status: Partial recovery via hard fork

## 3. Attack Vector
- Technical entry point: Recursive call vulnerability
- Vulnerability type: Reentrancy
- Preconditions required:
  - Public withdraw function
  - State update after external call

## 4. Root Cause
- Design flaw in withdrawal logic
- Failure to update internal balances before external calls
- Governance delay preventing emergency intervention

## 5. Attack Execution Flow
1. Attacker created a malicious contract
2. Initiated withdrawal from The DAO
3. External call triggered fallback function
4. Recursive withdrawals executed before balance update
5. Funds drained into child DAO

## 6. Detection Possibility
- Abnormal recursive call patterns
- Rapid balance drain anomalies
- Unusual gas consumption per transaction

## 7. Preventive Signals (Retrospective)
- Detection of external calls before state mutation
- Recursive execution depth anomalies
- Large withdrawal loops in short timeframes

## 8. Mapping to SentinelZero
- Risk Category: Contract Logic Risk
- SentinelZero Flag:
  - Unsafe state update ordering
  - Reentrancy-prone patterns
- Preventive Insight:
  - Highlight contracts where external calls precede internal state changes
